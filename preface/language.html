    Fabricating Language
  </h2>

  <p>Language is a difficult topic for discussion because it is such an inperceivable part of our experience of reality. It is one of the most primitive methods which human can interpet meaning. So ingrained is language in our humanity that we even comprehend reality internally through self-dialog, a stream of consciousness championed by an internal narrator explaning an interpretation of reality back to ourselves.</p>
  <p>Even though day in, day out we reap the benefits of language's evolution as a method of effectively exchanging meaning between biological information processing machines, we are still hesitant to accept its utility when creating systems of codified meaning for computers, choosing instead to manufacture new systems of meaning, often with a near religious devotion to the prescribed axioms and standards of its creators.</p>

  <h2 class="ui header">
    Tending to Tendencies

  </blockquote>

  <p>Creating a system is no easy task. All decisions made by an individual, even <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/external/files/Garner_s_American_The_Ongoing_Struggles_of_Garlic-Hangers.pdf?version=2014-10-15-1630">those with the best intentions</a> towards impartiality, add some aspects of themselves as an imprint on their work.</a>
  </p>
  <p>Programming languages are relatively nascent technologies. The first widely used languages are only around fifty years old. Many people have relatives who are older than computer programming's entire history. As many have noted, often what seem to be the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IfSmalltalkIsSoGoodWhyDoesNobodyUseIt">better language</a> loses out to something else.</p>





    What we know to be the entire breadth of programming syntax and concepts comes from  and institutions, often with particular interests, business objectives, personal  attached to the success of the languages. I believe programming culture have succumbed to a certain set of central tendencies</p>

  <h3>Predisposition towards Rational Argument</h3>

   <p>Many programmers not only solve complex abstract problems routinely, but spend their free time thinking about the meta-tendencies of solving problems. How can i write this quicker next time? How can I avoid repetitive tasks? How can I abstract this out to be re-used? There is a fundamental tendency for computer programmers who are innate problem solvers to look for intellectual solutions to problems, to see all problems as solvable using the same techniques which problems are solved inside the curly quotes of programming.</p>

   <p>These predispositions are extremely useful traits for system design, but can lead to biases as a field to intellectualize issues, to search for a unifying set of axioms which should guide all future programming. For one, simple solutions may not always feel as gratifying as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">complex ones</a>. The current version of programmatic truth is usually seen as the Truth, the current best practices, as the only practice for a good developer, whether next year they might be disavowed or forgotten for the new big thing. This mania drives forward innovation, many of the <em>new big thing</em> become the <em>old standard</em> soon enough, but still encourages a shared, irrational obsession with novel rational appeal.</p>

  <h3>Predisposition towards Prescription</h3>
  <p>Classifying, creating rules, drawing boundaries are all essential parts of being a programmer. Much of what makes up the functionality of programming may not have common accepted language, so individuals are forced to construct language more than many other fields. Many of those 'named things' in programming, the guts of a program, will only be read by several people in their lifetime, sometimes even one, so the conventions can be determined by particular, singular conditions.</p>
  <p>Programmers who are limited by the predetermined syntax of interpreted languages (the parts of code defined for machines), feel bound to use similar machine-like rules for naming the parts of code defined just for other human editors.</p>

  <h3>Predisposition towards the Primacy of Computational Efficiency</h3>
  <p>Many coding languages are still chosen under the belief that the most important features of a language is computational efficiency. For a long time this was true. Systems were just too slow, and compilers too inefficient to deal with code that didn't make <b>the needs of computers tantamount</b>. This may have been painfully obvious in a period of time when <a href="http://www.mkomo.com/cost-per-gigabyte-update">most personal computers didn't have hard drives</a>.</p>

  <p> But this period is drawing to a close. Not only are processors' transistors only a few nanometers wide, but compiler improvements by browser-makers increase performance by <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/12/new-crankshaft-for-v8.html">double digits</a> regularly.</p>
  <p>The age when images, text, and video cannot be constructed, manipulated, an animated on a page at sixty frames-per-second are drawing to a close, yet many programming languages do not appear to acknowledge the need to adjust for this shift in focus.</p>


  <h2 class="ui header">Twin Brothers</h2>

  <p>Even if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)">pure functionalism</a> and the talk of humans as being peculiar types of machines makes you want to run and hide in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">far away room</a>, the argument that natural languages are much better equipped than prescribed languages to create meaning doesn't necessarily have to be tackled philosophically.</p>
  <p>Many features of natural languages are <a href="http://huh.ideophone.org/">convergent</a>, arising simultenously in different parts of the world with no contact. Natural languages even evolved under similar constraints as programming languages.</p>

  <p>Bandwidth plays a critical role in natural languages, being even more restrictive than computer systems. Speaking requiring us to physically contort internal valves in our larynx to modulate the frequency of waves of air pressure at a rate of only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute#Speech_and_listening">150 or so words</a> per minute—and that's not say anything of the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1315292/">fascinating complexity</a> in our capacity to observe those same modulations.</p>
  <p>Natural languages are also designed to limit not just the length of encoding to a collection of sounds, but also to optimally limit the conceptual scope of ideas into classes, <b>nouns</b>, and account for varying implementations of an idea effectively through qualifiers.</p>
  <p>Often times the <b>connotations</b> (tech-speak "implementation") may vary from person to person of an idea. <b>Love</b> may connote ideas of romantic love, or in others felings of agape, or specific memories with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia">a quality</a> you only can understand, yet four letters and one sylabble are enough to contain the concept.</p>
  <p>A single idea may also vary from instance to instance. A normal <b>horse</b> might have four legs, but if you encountered a three-legged horse you would find no difficulty considering it a horse. In fact, you may never encounter a three-legged horse, and still might store space for it conceptually based purely on your imagination of the possibility. Or the classic Wittgenstein example of  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-game_(philosophy)#Description">What is a game?</a>". Natural language can accomodate for these variations in implementation, tempered by a "development history" that started longer ago than we even had the means to record it</p>

  <h2 class="ui header">Narrowing the Focus</h2>

  <h3 class="ui header">Creating a Vocabulary for Design</h3>
  <p>Individual interface elements are the <b>nouns</b> (tech-speak "classes") which provide a <b>context</b> ("scope") to <b>limit the broadness</b> ("encapsulate") of <b>modifiers</b> ("properties") and <b>behaviors</b> ("methods").</p>
  <p>Natural languages are used today for describing interface design, although they aren't usually considered in the actual process of coding interfaces. Words like <b>popup</b>, <b>dropdown</b>, and <b>modal</b> didn't exist twenty years ago, yet now most people who visit websites understand these as essential elements of a design. They know what to expect from their behavior, how to use them and can distinguish them in a design.</p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Well What is "Everyone Else" Doing?</h3>

  <p>The resolute success industry-wide of "flatening" design: removing gradients and reducing uses of shadows, recanting of skeumorphic design, defining relationships through negative spacing instead of borders, etc. shows there is a directionality to interface languages. We can convey meaning with less <a href="http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/affordances.html">affordances</a> than ever, not primarily because web developers understanding of design has evolved, but because <b>users understanding of design has evolved from years of usage</b>.</p>

  <h2 class="ui header">Drawing Limits</h2>
  <p>It's important to explain, that this argument only applies directly to <b>exchange languages like HTML</b> and not all programming languages. The meat and potato of most programming can be more much more complex. Moods, sentiments, feelings—the internal "processing languages" of meaning in organic systems can difficult to comprehend, and utterly unaccountable by language.</p>
